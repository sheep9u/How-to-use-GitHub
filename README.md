1. A version <mark>control</mark> system.

2. It tracks changes to files.

3. Think of it like save point.

## Creating a repository

Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.

> 分支使您可以同时拥有一个存储库的不同版本。

By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

> 默认情况下，您的存储库有一个名为 main 的分支，该分支被认为是最终分支。 您可以在存储库中从 main 创建其他分支。 您可以使用分支一次拥有一个项目的不同版本。 当您想在不更改主要代码源的情况下向项目添加新功能时，这很有用。 在合并之前，不同分支上完成的工作不会显示在主分支上，我们将在本指南后面介绍。 您可以使用分支进行试验和编辑，然后再将它们提交给主分支。

When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of
main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main
branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

> 当您在主分支之外创建分支时，您正在制作主分支在该时间点的副本或快照。 如果您在分支上工作时其他人对主分支进行了更改，您可以引入这些更新。
